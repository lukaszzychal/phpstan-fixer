## Testing
- Add/adjust tests when behavior changes or bugs are fixed
- Run relevant suites (PHPUnit/PHPStan) when feasible; state when not run
- Follow test structure: Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Write descriptive test method names that explain what is being tested
- Ensure unit tests for individual components and integration tests for interactions
- Test edge cases and error conditions; all tests pass before committing
