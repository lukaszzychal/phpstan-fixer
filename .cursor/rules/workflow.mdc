## Workflow & Tooling
- Use `apply_patch` for code edits; avoid destructive git commands
- One logical change per commit/message; clear, descriptive commit messages
- Use `@phpstan-ignore*` only with justification
- Maintain PHPStan level 5 or higher; fix all errors before committing
- Collect PHPStan errors for analysis: save to `log-errors-phpstan/` with timestamps
- Follow conventional commits format when possible (feat:, fix:, refactor:, etc.)
