## Coding Guidelines
- Small, single-responsibility methods; prefer explicit types and named constants
- Avoid duplication; extract shared logic when it improves clarity
- Match existing fixer/test patterns for consistency
- Use existing fixer/test patterns as reference; keep new fixers and tests consistent
- Prioritize simplicity over cleverness; simple solutions are easier to maintain
- Keep methods small (ideally < 20 lines); extract long methods into smaller ones
